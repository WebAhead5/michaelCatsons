# michaelCatsons

This site is designed as a one page portfolio for <b>The Michael Catsans Dev Team</b>, to provide an overview of the team, an introduction to each of the team members, and the ability to contact us directly via a web form.

The site contains the following elements delivered through separate iFrames, navigable via a floating nav bar:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Header:</b> Page title</li>
    <li> <b>About Us:</b> Team introduction</li>
    <li> <b>Team Members:</b> pictures and introduction to all 4 team members (Moris, Farid, Hadi & Jake)</li>
    <li> <b>Contact Form:</b> gives user ability to submit a message alongside their name and email address. </li>
</ul>

To create the page, we first sat down as a team to discuss the User Stories and sketch out an initial design for the website. We then assignd each team member to complete an individual section, ensuring that we had one team member working on the overall page container (including design and the nav bar) to pull all of the seperate sections together.

The team had some initial problems working on a master CSS file, and decided to implement separate CSS files for each page element to reduce the amount of conflicts that were occurring on GitHub. The team then focussed on ensuring that the site worked correctly on mobile devices and had a consistent design across all elements of the page to ensure that the final look and feel of the website was professional. We ensured that we met and communicated frequently during the development process so that all of the team members were always working effectivally together.
