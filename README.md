## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Our process  

To create the page, we first sat down as a team to discuss the User Stories and sketch out an initial design for the website. We then assignd each team member to complete an individual section, ensuring that we had one team member working on the overall page container (including design and the nav bar) to pull all of the seperate sections together.

The team had some initial problems working on a master CSS file, and decided to implement separate CSS files for each page element to reduce the amount of conflicts that were occurring on GitHub. The team then focussed on ensuring that the site worked correctly on mobile devices and had a consistent design across all elements of the page to ensure that the final look and feel of the website was professional. We ensured that we met and communicated frequently during the development process so that all of the team members were always working effectivally together.

## :bulb: What we learned 


We learned:

- That working with iFrames can be very difficult when combining into one single page;
- Seperate CSS files are better than just one one (& importing CSS is possible);
- That communication is very important during the design, development and bug fix process;
- How to better utilise Git Hub when working on a project;
- Overall deeper understanding of CSS and HTML, particualry CSS Flexbox an how to implement on mobile.
